<p>New York, October 11.
At the investigation into the affairs of
the American life insurance companies, Mr.
McCurdy, President of the New York Mutual,
stated that his salary was £30,000 per annum.
He also gave explanations showing that large
sums were drawn from a company with which
he has business relations, by members of his
family.	</p>
<p>Mr. Qjyphant, Chairman of the Expenditure
Committee of the Mutual Life, stated that the
company maintained a confidential fund for
legal expenses, of which the total amounts are
only known to the trustees. Mr. Gillette, the
Vice-President of the company, testified that
the solicitor of the company could get £5,000
whenever he pleased, without disclosing the
destination of the money. Mr. Gillette men-
tioned that the company contributed £8,000
to the Republican Campaign Fund in 1904.

yesterday, the hearing of the motion brought
by the Egyptian Government to set aside the
opposition made by the Princes of the late
Khedive Ismail’s family to the payment by the
Daria Sanieh Company of nearly $2,000,000
to be made on the 16th inst., took place at the
Cairo Mixed Tribunals, Judge Somerville Tuck
sitting in Chambers (audience de Refere).</p>
	<p>Melter Molten, avocat du Contentieux,
appeared for the Government and, after ex-
plaining the claims brought by the Princes
against the Government, moved that the inhibi-
ion contained in their citation be removed, as
being neither made in virtue of a deed proving
a legal claim nor sanctioned by the authorization
of the judge. He quoted numerous precedents
to show that a judge in Chambers had jaris-
diction to remove an illegal obstacle, such as
the inhibition. </p>
	<p>Matter Carton de Wiart, representing the
Daria Sanieh Company, replied to the Princes’
advocate and supported the Government’s 
motion. He explained some of the decisions 
which Maltre Linant had cited and in which
the apparently adverse views taken were justi-
find by the fact that in those particular cases
there was no urgency and the attachment was 
not made on sums of money but on securities.</p>
	<p>The Judge them closed the hearing, announc-
ing that his decision would be given later.</p>
	<p>This case of the Princes, who are treating
the Government as if it were an insolvent 
debtor, was regarded with great interest, and
the small hall of the Refere was inconveniently
crowded.</p>

	<p>The Court has decided that it is competent
to receive the application of the Government
and to try the case. It annuls the inhibition
made by the Princes on the monies of the
Daria Sanieh and the Daira Sanieh Company
and has ordered these sums to be paid over
to the Government on the 16th inst. and
condemned the Princes to pay the costs of the
hearing. </p></div>

diphtheria took place among the pupils of
the boys and girls' schools of the Hellenic Com-
munity of Alexandria. Two little girls died
of the disease, and the governing Board
promptly disinfected the schools, and closed
them at an earlier date than usual, with a
view to preventing any epidemic breaking
out among the children. The Board, we hear,
is not altogether pleased with the action of
the Municipality, which has installed a
public convenience within a few yards of the
windows of the Boys’ School. It seems to us
that no worse site could have been chosen
for this structure. Its presence must cause
considerable discomfort and inconvenience to
a large proportion of the 1,500 pupils of the

   <p> We learn from a reliable source that the
negotiations between the Anglo-American Nile
Steamer and Hotel Company and the Hamburg
America Steamship Company have concluded
in an amalgamation under terms which are in
every way satisfactory to both parties con-
cerned.</p>
    <p>It is some time ago since Egypt learnt that
the Hamburg America Steamship Company was
desirous of starting a Nile steamer service and
at first it was understood that the venture
would be made independently of the com-
panies already established, notably Messrs.
Thomas Cook and Son, and the company with
which they have just come to terces. Some
agitation was evinced and the opinion was
expressed in some quarters that German enter-
price should not be allowed the opportunity of 
ousting those companies which had a prior right.
The matter was taken up in London, and quest-
tions were asked in Parliament, but, as is so 
often the case, no definite answer either satis-
factory or otherwise was vouchsafed. </p>
	<p>Shortly afterwards it was rumoured that
the conditions under which Nile traffic is
carried on were about to be changed, and that
the exchange would in all probability deter any
would-be interloper from entering into com-
petition with the established companies. Then
we learnt that negotiations for the amalgama-
ion of the Hamburg-America line with the
Anglo-American were pending, and later that
arrangements had been made for meetings
between the directors of the two companies at
Paris or Berlin. We have more than once 
prophesied the result of these negotiations, and
our anticipations now appear to have been
well-founded.</p>
	<p>It cannot, of course, be said with certainty
what will be the result of this amalgamation,
but it has certainly prevented any serious
competition. The Anglo-American line is well-
known and is yearly making rapid strics ;
strengthened by the valuable support of the
strengthened by the valuable support of the
Hamburg-America company, with the con-
combatant addition to its capital and conse-
quent increase of its fleet, it cannot fail to
progress still more rapidly. What with the 
yearly increase of Nile traffic there is plenty
scope for two such lines as Messrs. Thomas
Cook & Son and the new amalgamation, and
we have every hope of seeing a continued im-
provident in the already excellent services,
without either party suffering from the inevit-
able but healthy competition of its rival.</p></div>

Effendi Girgis, assistant stationmaster of
Alexandria, whilst on duty, mounted an engine
with the intention of descending at the
north end of the yard to give instructions with
regard to the next train which would pass
and jumped off before the complete stoppage
of the engine, catching his left foot in the
wheel. The fore part of his foot was crushed,
and he was carried into the station, conscious
but b’eeding terribly. Medical assistance was
sent for at once and an outside doctor arrived
at the same time as the two railway doctors.
The rushed part of the foot was immediately
amputated while the patient was under the
influence of anesthetic. After the operation
the injured man was taken to the German
hospital, where he is progressing favorably
under Dr. Morrison’s care. It is believed that

Oases, as follows:- The underground artesian
supply being practically inexhaustible, the
output at the surface may be almost inde-
finitely augmented, provided the wells are
suunk in suitable localities and kept sufficiently
far apart to avoid any appreciable reduction
of the hydrostatic pressure. The 0ases lands
have one great advantage over those of the
Nile Valley in that they are not dependent on
the time, volume, and duration of the Nile
flood. With proper care and attention the
output of wells remains constant,and in several

soon after dawn and transferred her mails to
the waiting Marmora which goes direct through
the canal, whereas last week, the mail steamer
was obliged to remain some few days, though
arrangements had been made for sending on
the mail bags as quickly as possible by train.
One may say now that the passage of vessels
through the canal either way has reached
practically a normal condition. To-day ten
vessels came up close together and it was
somewhat difficult to find berths for them.
A few ships have been obliged to tie up
further down the canal on account of the
strong breeze which has prevailed all night
and to-day ; these, with the residue of the
third and last fleet, which was in the Bitter
lakes yesterday waiting the passage of the
outward bound vessels, will, all being well,
arrive at this end shortly. Two small British
second class cruisers arrived from seaward
yesterday and tied up in the Dutch Basin
and Rive Asie respectively,having their pilot
flags hoisted soon after noon to-day for the
canal. The Bibby liner Cheshire, which, owing
to the great movement in the harbour early
this morning was ordered to anchor in the
roads, came in at eleven, and disembarked
Mr. Yeilding who had taken passage on the
ship from home.</p></div>

<head>BRITISH ASSOCIATION HOMEWARD-
BOUND.</head>
 <p>The Castle liner Durham Castle came out of
the Canal to-day soon after ten, and remained
for some hours to take in coal, water, and
provisions. Those members of the British
Association I had the pleasure of seeing spoke
most highly of the pleasant time they have
had during their enforced stay in Egypt
Several of them have been to Cairo and further
afield, as was told in the "Gazette” on Monday.
Great regret is expressed by several of them
that they did not have the oppotunity of
seeing anything of Kibendini and the other
equally interesting environs of Mombasa, as
their stay was so short in that port, but a
party appear to have made a considerable tour
around the harbour and bays of Mombesa,
and all declare that they have had a most
interesting and enjoyable time.</p></div>

<head>REGATTA.</head>
<p>The following, is the result of yesterday's
regatta :-</p>

   <p>The wind came up about 2 p.m. very strong
from the N.E., which no doubt accounts for
such a poor attendance at the sailing races.</p>
   <p> At about 4.30 p.m, the representative pairs
of the "Club Nautique Francais" and the
"Club Internationale Canottieri” started from
the breakwater elbow buoy ; the day, on
account of the high wind, was not at all an
ideal one for rowing races, there being at the
starting buoy quite a high sea for such boats.</p>
     <p>The Canottieri went away in fine style, and
from the first had it all their own way, the
Francais suffering very much from the inex-
perience of their cox, who did not line them
up at the start, and during the whole race
steered a very bad course. They gave up
after going about two-thirds the length of the
course, having shipped a good deal of water.</p>
   <p> The umpire’s launch then took them in
tow, but the line appears to have been made
fast not to the bow but to one of the seats
of the boat. The cox left his post without
fixing the rudder, and the boat, getting broad
side on to the direction of the tow; promptly
filled and capsized ; the crew were rescued by
the launch. </p>
   <p> As the boat was full of water when brought
in and had also lost its two sliding seats, the
second heat of the competition could not be
rowed off, and will therefore take place at
5 p.m. this afternoon.</p>
  <p> The following is the handicapped programme 
of the events for to-tomorrow when his Highness

<p>Londen, October 5</p>
<p>The money market bag again dominated all
Stock Exchange values since our last. It is
generally recognised that the Bank return
during the first days of October, usually shows
the reserve to be the smallest of the whole
twelve months, and this is accounted for,
under normal conditions, by the autumn de-
mand for cash throughout the country. This
year, however, the heavy foreign withdraw-
also of gold and the detaining of large amounts
in Egypt have brought the reserve to below
21,000,000 and the proportion of liabilities 
down to 37 5/5 %. This has had a disquieting
effect and has produced a state of nervousness
throughout the week, especially as the Bank
of Berlin has put its Bank rate up to 5 %. It
is felt that unless the Bank rate here is
made effective a further advance in the 
near future will be necessary. There are
those who are of opinion that in any ease,
owing to the further demands of gold for
Egypt and South America, we shall certainly
see such an advance before the end of the
year. Those who hold this view put forward,
in support of their opinion, in addition to
the reasons already stated, the fact that Ame-
rica is still buying bar gold in the open
market here.</p>
<p>The above reasons have naturally had a
weakening effect upon investment stocks
last we wrote, and Conso’s, which on Tuesday
were only a shade under 89, close today at
88 3/4 for the s/c and 88 1/2 for cash. At the
same time, this renewed falling away in prices
this afternoon is attributed to some heavy 
liquidation which is going on, and the low
prices touched today are not alone due to
the monetary position. The foreign market
also has been dull throughout the week,
Russians having declined a full point to 94
since our last and the whole list of Japanese
stocks having shed 1/8 from last Friday’s
quotations. News from Paris seems to con-
firm the report of the proposed new Russian
loan of £72,000,000, which, it is stated, will
be issued simultaneously in England, France,
Germany, America, and, possibly, one of the
smaller countries, provided the difficulty
arising out of the difference in prices, in the
various international markets can be overcome
so as to permit a common price of issue. Failing
this the idea is that the total loan will be
reduced to £40,000,000; a 4 % loan at 90.</p>
       <p> Referring to our remarks above on the
money market it is being pointed out that the
strong position of Paris, which, in view of this
proposed Russian loan it is to the interest of
the Paris Bankers to maintain by permitting,
if necessary, gold to be sent to London, is an
element which should allay the fears of those
who anticipate a higher Bank rate.</p>
<p> Home rails, although some companies have
had most excellent traffic for the past week,
have suffered from the prevailing depression
owing to the money outlook. Reports from the
iron and steel districts are of the most satis-
factory and cheerful description. Trade is
active and prosperous, all of which means
better business for the, railways, especially
those in the north which carry heavy minerals.
Americans have likewise been scared by the
possibility of dearer money, though not to the
same extent as home securities. New York
anticipated a 4 1/2% rate yesterday, but as soon
as it was known that the Directors had made
no change prices hardened up all round in the
Yankee market. Canadian Pacific shares were
on offer, especially after the meeting of the
company, with the result of which he share-
holders were apparently disappointed, as they
had anticipated some reference would be made
to the land scheme which, in a large measure,
has been the cause of the recent rises. The
shares close today at 178 1/2.</p>
  <p>Egyptian Land and Financial shares remain
steady but firm,with very little business doing.
Both National and Agricultural Banks main-
tain their level, and are quoted to-day at 27 3/5
and 9 respectively.</p>
	<p>In the mining market the public still keep
everely aloof from, South Africans, and Rho-
desians are being affected by the general
drooping tendency of Kaffirs.</p>
 <p>There has been little business done, to
Egyptian mines. Nile Valleys have weakened
somewhat and dose today at*lA a Mpon the
week of 1/8. United Africans are 1 9/15 The amount
realised by the shipment of gold from the Um
Rus mine for the month of August was
£1,185, end the Mysore rWt shipment for the
same month was sold for £69,280, not includ-
ing the value of gold contained in copper bars.</p></div>
