                    <p>If the statement that M. Delcasse is the
                    real author of the now famous articles in the
                    "Matin" is correct, the ex-Minister of Foreign
                    Affairs has played his country a sorry trick in
                    giving the world what common sense would
                    have left unwritten and unsaid. Germany is
                    still a dangerous power to provoke; the failure
                    of her forces against the Hereos does not imply
                    that they are unfitted for European warfare,

                    churian campaign, differing in no essential from
                    those employed in the French  manoeuvers, and
                    the idea that a great anti-German conspiracy
                    had been formed at the time of the first
                    difficulties that arose from the Kaiser's visit
                    to Morocco might enlist millions who have
                    hitherto offered lukewarm support or frank
                    opposition to the IMperial policy, in the cause
                    of "Gott, Kaiser, and Vaterland." There is no
                    question that the German military party, if
                    unwilling to face France and Russia, would
                    welcome the oppurtunity of encountering 
                    France single-handed, and the British offer of
                    100,000 men would not save the situation
                    were the French armies to be overthrown on
                    the frontier. We prefer to believe that M.
                    Delcasse is too good a friend of his country
                    and of the Anglo- French entente, to risk 
                    the future of both by so strange an in-
                    discretion. To publish the British offers
                    to aid France, to indicate the British
                    plan of campaign, and to irritate German
                    Chauvinists and French and British diplom-
                    atists alike is not worthy of a diplomatist.
                    The articles are more probable the work
                    of some ingenious and sensational journalist
                    anxious to see the "Matin" sell well, but even
                    so they will not improve the continental
                    situation, terribly strained by the efforts of
                    Chauvinists, and complicated by the Austrian
                    difficulty and the financial and military reverses
                    of Russia. That an understanding between
                    France and England is necessary, we admit; 
                    understandings are often the parents of alli-
                    ances, but that the publication (or invention)
                    of military and diplomatic correspondence of
                    the highest importance exchanged between
                    the two powers with a view to meeting an
                    attack by the third, seems to us to be an extra
                    ordinary error of judgement, calculated, unless
                    promptly denied; to precipitate the event to
                    avoid which the entente was sealed.</p>

In spite of the prorogation, M. Andrassy

the thousands of pilgrims who visit the port

constructed a fountain, the pure water of
which was drawn from a distant spring, and
called it the Hamidieh fountain. The water
supply, however, proved very intermittent and
his Majesty recently issued an irade to the
effect that the fountain should be repaired as
soon as possible. A sum of L.T. 9,000 was
set aside for the scheme, and the work was

Chamber are always at the disposal of any
member desiring information on trade matters
generally, including the question of appoint-
ing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for
such advice, it is obviously in the interests of
a British traders here to become members,
especially when it is remembered that the
annual subscription is merely the nominal one
of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy

<head>SUICIDE OF A BRITISH SOLDIER.</head>
<p>The adjourned inquest into the cicum-
stances attending the death of Private Charles
Harris of the 2nd battalion of the Rifle Brigade,
by shooting himself in the head at the Citadel
barracks on Monday morning, was resumed
yesterday at the British Consulate.</p>
   <p>The first witness called was Sergeant Willian
Walker, who was on duty at the main quarter 
guard, and who related how he found the body
of the deceased as already mentioned in out
previous issue. He stated in answer to a ques-
ion that about sic months ago he noticed a
change in the demeanor of the man, who
seemed more than usually quiet and reserved.</p>
  <p>Four other witnesses were then examined,
but their evidence was of little importance.
The sixth witness was Private James Wood of
the same company who deposed that he had
known the deceased for three years and was
his best friend.  He met him last on Saturday
at the canteen and he seemed in his usual
spirits, but about two weeks ago, Harris
told him that he had quite enough of the 
troubles at home.  The deceased, however, did
not say of what nature, these troubles were. In
answer to a question from one of the jurors the
witness said that Private harris had never in
the cosafd of conversation led him to think
that he had any intention of taking his life.
The next who gave evidence was Colar
Sergeant Michael Josephy, who had inspected
the kit of the dead man and found a letter
addressed to his mother. This letter was opened
by the coroner and handed to the jury to read.
It was undated, and stated that the writer was 
quite tired of the troubles he had to go 
through. The witness added that the deceased
was a very dull man and backward in his drill.
In answer to a question from a juror Sergeant
Joseph said that he had never complained to
him about being annoyed by any of his
comrades.</p>
 <p> Captain Claude Kidd Morgan, of the R.A.M.C.,
was the last witness called. He deposed having 
been called at 6 o’clock on Monday morning
to examine the body, which was found near the 
tennis court with the rifle lying near it and
pointing upwards. The cause of death was a
rifle bullet, which had entered by the mouth
and come out the back of the head, lacerat-
ing the base of the brain and causing instan-
taaeous death. Witness had no doubt whatever
that the wound was self-inflicted, as he saw 
that deceased had attached one end of his boot
lace to his right foot and the other end to the
trigger of the rifle.</p>
  <p>The jury at 1.15 p.m., without retiring, gave 
a verdict of suicide whilst temporarily iusame.</p></div>

<p>This morning the first hearing of the ques-
tion arising from the claims of the Princes,
heirs of the late Ismail Pasha took place at
the Cairo Mixed Tribunals, before Judge Tuck,
the Juge de Refere. Maltre Molteni, Conten-
tieux to the Ministry of Finances, represented
the Government, Matre Carton de Wiart the
Credit Foncier and Daira Sanieh Companies,
while Maltre Count Petracchi watched over
the interests of the Daira Sanieb, in the
absence of Maltre Manusardi. Maltre Linant
was the advocate of the Princes.</p>
<p>The proceedings opened with an able expose
of the whole case by Me. Molteni on behalf of
the Egyptian Government Me. Linant replied
at some length, giving the views of his clients,
after which Me.Carton de Wiart, in an eloquent
speech, summed up the situation from the point
of view of the companies involved. The Court
then adjourned to consider its decision, and a
notice was shortly afterwards issued to the
Press announcing that the judgment would not
be communicated to tho public before 9 a.m.
to-morrow, Thursday.</p></div>

<head>THE DAY OF ATONEMENT.</head>

<p>While in all countries it is interesting to
note the observance of various religious festi-
vals and fasts, it becomes doubly so when,
as is the case in Alexandria, nationalities
too numerous to mention are gathered to-
gether under one roof to take part in the
service of the day. In the: “Referee,” four
years ago, Mr. G. R Sims (who writes as
"Dagonet” under the heading “Mustard and
Cress"), gave a very graphic account of
a visit he paid to the East London
Tabernacle in the Mile End road (which
had been lent to the Jews for the occa-
sion) on the Day of Atonement. Here, of
course, would be gathered together a vast
number of the foreign Jews who people White-
chapel and Bethnal Green, and Mr.Sims bore
testimony to the earnestness that marked the
demeanour of all present at this solemn service.
This was equally marked in the synagogue in
Rue Temple Menasce, where, under the gui-
dance of my friend Rudolph I attended the
service on Sunday evening last. We entered
the buildiug-abont 6 o’clock and fonod it crowd-
ed. Men, youths, and young boys, almost with-
out exception wearing white scarfs with coloured
ends, filled the synsgogaue to its utmost capacity,
the porch also being full. In the gallery high
up ladies were sitting, but as only the front
rows were visible from below,their numbers could
not be estimated. Shortly afterwards, the
Sanctuary was opened by the Chief Warden, Mr.
Joseph Gore, and the Scroll of the Law enclosed
in elaborately ornamented silver vessels, three
in number, was brought out. The Reader then,
from the steps of the Sanctuary, read the Grand
Prayer seven times, the congregation repeating
it after he had finished each recital.</p>
<p>The silver vessels containing the Scroll of
the Law were then carried round the building.
During the progress of the procession the
Chief Warden beckoned us to come to the
Sanctuary steps, and after he had restored the
scroll to its place an closed the Sanctuary
doors for another twelve months, kindly in-
vited os to accompany him to his seat. For
some time we sat and listened to the prayers
read from the marble desk in the centre of the
building by the Reader, which were attentively
followed and responded to by the congrega-
tion. We stayed till what is called "the silent
prayer," uttured in a very subdued tone by all
present, had been said, and then left the Syna-
gogue. I learned that the service would be
continued until about 10 o’clock, that the
building would remains open all night, and
that at an early hour on Monday morning
prayers would be resumed and continued all
day (with short intervals) terminating soon
after six o’clock, when the exhausting fast
won d be at an end. On the following day I
visited the synagogue for a short time in the
early afternoon, during an interval. A subdued
conversation was going on, but not of a character
calculated in the least to mar the solemnity of
the occasion, and no signs of exhaustion were
apparent. This I thought somewhat remarkable,
considering the strict nature of the fast as from
before sunset on the ninth day of the month
Tisri till after sunset on the tenth, no kind,
of food whatever must he eaten, nor even a
drop of water taken.</p>
<p>When one reflects on the regularity with
which this fast is observed year after year in all
countries—for there are few where the Jew is
not found—it is more easily understood how
the race has survived all the persecutions of
past centuries, and the possibility of their
reunion some day in a country of their own, if
not in Palestine. No more severe test of con-
formity to ancient laws and customs could be
found than the “Black Fast” of the Jews,
and few religions could be found now-a-days,
the professors of Which men, women, and
children—would go through the ordeal of 17
hours abstinence from food at a stretch, once
every year. The wonderful vitality of the
Jewish race remains as strong as ever. Efforts
to proselytise meet with scant success, and
indeed such methods as those exposed in
a letter written to the editor, of the “Ga-
zette” a few months ago—and allowed to
pass unchallenged—only go to show the im-
mense stability of the ancient religion of the
children of Israel, and the difficulty in the
way of those who would lessen its influences.</p>
